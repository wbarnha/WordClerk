# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-15)

**Core value:** Legal citation checks and hyperlinks must be accurate and trustworthy — a hallucination check must never falsely report a fabricated citation as "verified."
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — escaping-hardening

## Current Position

Phase: 02 (escaping-hardening) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4 (Tasks 1-3 complete; Task 4 blocked on human publish action, D-03)
Status: Blocked at checkpoint — awaiting human confirmation of openclerk-core@0.3.0 publish
Last activity: 2026-07-16 — Plan 02-01 Tasks 1-3 committed in openclerk-core; Task 4 checkpoint returned

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: `openclerk-core` dependency cleanup (CORE-01/02) sequenced as Phase 1 so escaping-hardening and provider-dedup refactors build on a clean, non-vendored baseline and avoid merge conflicts with PR #33.
- Roadmap: word.ts split (WORDTS-01/02) excluded from this roadmap — deferred to v2 during requirements scoping, per PROJECT.md Out of Scope.
- PROJECT.md: Bumped PR #33's `openclerk-core` dependency from git tag `v0.2.1` to npm registry `^0.2.6` (v0.2.1 predates ReDoS fixes and a hallucination-verification bypass fix; git-tag dependency fails to install under npm's `allow-scripts` policy).
- [Phase ?]: PR #33 merged via GitHub merge-commit strategy (0f48462); openclerk-core@0.2.6 confirmed resolved from public npm registry, build/test green, hallucination-check Core Value guard preserved verbatim in word.ts.
- [Phase ?]: Fresh post-merge duplication audit confirmed zero logic in src/commands/ or scripts/ duplicates openclerk-core; CONCERNS.md duplication tech-debt entry marked Resolved, closing CORE-02.
- [Phase ?]: openclerk-core bumped to 0.3.0 (semver minor) for the new SafeHyperlinkUrl/SafeHtml branded types and smart constructors; local commits ready, publish requires human tag push per D-03.
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 02 Plan 01]: openclerk-core@0.3.0 published via PR #18 merge (feat/escape-01-branded-types -> main) + human tag push v0.3.0; publish.yml run 29467821795 succeeded; npm view confirms 0.3.0 resolvable from public registry. PR path used instead of direct push since local main had diverged from origin/main via historical rebase-merges.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `TERMS.md` §8 governing-law jurisdiction is a placeholder (`[jurisdiction to be specified]`) — may need counsel input; tracked as a separate task, does not block PR #27 merge in Phase 4 (SUBMIT-01).
- Partner Center category/industry tag selection (Phase 4) depends on the live Partner Center picker UI — not confirmed by research, re-check at submission time.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward from previous milestone close:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| word.ts decomposition | WORDTS-01/02 — split word.ts into workflows/*.ts modules | Deferred to v2 | Requirements scoping, 2026-07-15 |
| Manifest | MANIFEST-03 — hide/disable USPTO Patent Center provider stub | Deferred to v2 | Requirements scoping, 2026-07-15 |
| Legal | LEGAL-01 — resolve TERMS.md §8 governing-law jurisdiction | Deferred to v2 | Requirements scoping, 2026-07-15 |
