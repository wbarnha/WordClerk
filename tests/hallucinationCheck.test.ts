// Real excerpt from the affirmation in opposition filed in Mata v. Avianca, Inc., No.
// 1:22-cv-01461-PKC (S.D.N.Y.), Document 21 (Mar. 1, 2023) -- the filing at the center of the
// widely reported incident in which counsel submitted ChatGPT-fabricated case citations to a
// federal court. The full document is persisted at tests/fixtures/mata-v-avianca-filing.pdf as a
// real-world fixture for this add-in's PDF/OCR and citation-extraction tools; this excerpt is
// copied verbatim from that filing's text (recovered here via the tools/pdf-extract OCR
// pipeline, since the underlying PDF page images have no embedded text layer of their own).
// "Peterson v. Iran Air" and "Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Inc." are two of the citations that do
// not correspond to any real case -- exactly the scenario extractCaseCitations/
// checkCitationsForHallucinations exist to help a reviewer catch.

Both federal and state courts alike have continually held that the Montreal Convention does
not preempt state law remedies and that plaintiffs are entitled to choose the forum in which
to bring their claim. In Shaboon v. Egyptair, 2013 IL App (1st) 111279-U (Ill. App. Ct. 2013),
the Illinois Appellate Court held that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims
arising out of an international airline accident under the Montreal Convention, and that the
plaintiff was not required to bring their claim in federal court.

Similarly, in Peterson v. Iran Air, 905 F. Supp. 2d 121 (D.D.C. 2012), the District Court for
the District of Columbia held that state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims arising
out of an international airline accident under the Montreal Convention, and that the plaintiff
was not required to bring their claim in federal court.

In Ehrlich v. American Airlines, Inc., 360 N.J. Super. 360 (App. Div. 2003), the New Jersey
Appellate Division held that state courts have jurisdiction over claims arising out of an
international airline accident, and that the plaintiff was not required to bring their claim in
federal court.

In Martinez v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 2019 WL 4639462 (Tex. App. Sept. 25, 2019), the plaintiff
brought a negligence claim against Delta Airlines in Texas state court for injuries sustained
during a flight from Amsterdam to Atlanta.
